    Hexela's engineers have decades of experience delivering software that
    works, and that experience has taught us the fundamental rule of software -
    talk to the users.


    We do not believe in a 'one size fits all' approach. We will tailor our
    products to you and your users, to fit how you work. We will sit with you
    and listen - not train you how to change your workflow to fit our rigid
    solution. You are the experts in your field, and we are the experts at
    delivering software that will help you.

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
